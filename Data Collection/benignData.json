You find the description below. I hope you enjoy them as I did. Tell me in the comments which one is your #1 - or at least your #1.5 - I will include your vote in the ranking at the end of this text to see which commercial people like the most.\n\nThese ads are included:\n\n1. Cinesite Studios, \u201cBeans\u201d, also called \u201cNot for Austronauts\u201d or the \"Astronaut Ad\" from 2013, a mock ad \u2013 the non-existent Haynes Baked Beans only resemble Heinz \u2013 for the famous visual effects and feature animation studio known for movies like Harry Potter, Avengers: Infinity War, Captain America: Civil War, and others whose logo appears at the end. This hillarious commercial is often shown but not always understood.\n\n2. Doritos, \"Ultrasound\"/\u201cBirth\u201d from the 2016 Super Bowl was a highly controversial, yet extremely funny commercial that still has its fans and opponents\n\n3. Kia niro, \u201cHero\u201d with Melissa McCarthy from the 2017 Super Bowl, also refered to as \u201cI love Whales!\u201d that got a lot of press and features Bonnie Tyler's \u201cHolding up for a hero\u201d\n\n4.

Volkswagen VW Passat, \u201cThe Force\u201d, also called \"Darth Vader\" from 2011 Super Bowl - this  extended version was seen by 8 million viewers online before the game, a huge success at this time, during the game a shorter version was aired, later other versions/sequels followed, a game-changing commercial a lot of media was talking about and many people still enjoy.\n\n8. Clash Of Clans, \u201cRevenge\u201d with Liam Neeson as his famous character from Taken for the Super Bowl 2015, also famous for its line \u201cYou will regret the day you crossed AngryNeeson52\u201d\n\n9. Old Spice, \u201cJungle Wilderness\u201d from the 2011 Danger Zone campaign with the famous line \u201cYou smell like you look \u2013 amazing\u201d (the most amazing thing, though, is the line \u201cDramatization only. Do not attempt.\u201d in the bottom right corner at 7:21 - who would attempt THAT?) \n\n10. Wix, \"Disruptive World\" with Gal Gadot, the new Wonder Woman and Jason Statham from The Expandables and Transporter for the cloud-based web development platform for the Super Bowl 2017 in the extended version - with more than 22.6 million views online it was the most-seen commercial before the game.

We leave the opinion out...mostly. Our goal is to educate briefly on what moved the stock markets, what may be coming up, and how your investments, or retirement portfolio may have been impacted by the day's news.\n\nHere's a look at what investors were focused on today:\n\nThe markets were mostly lower today as investors stared at higher rates all day in a closed bond market. The Dow 30 was able to close higher on the day by 39, but the S&P 500 closed down 1, and the Nasdaq 100 closed lower by 52 as big tech stocks continue to slide.\n\nSector News\nSemiconductors (NYSE: SMH) continued their confident push to the downside today as the sector lost almost 2% on the day. Raymond James came out with a note that said the bottom is not in for the chip makers and this earnings season is likely to show more weakness overall in production.\nBrazilian ETF (NYSE: EWZ) continued it's sharp move higher as the market favorite to become the new President of Brazil took a commanding lead in the polls over the weekend. The election will head to a runoff though as the far-right lead candidate was unable to get to the 50% mark.\nVolatility shot higher again today as it has it's best 3 day performance since March. The popular fear index has been pushing higher as investors continue to move money from the overall markets and possibly into bonds now that it is a more attractive investment.\nStock News\nGeneral Electric (NYSE: GE) was upgraded again today as more and more analysts see the new CEO, Larry Culp as a breath of fresh (and profitable) air to the company as they restructure. The stock was higher today by another 2% as Barclays upgraded the stock as well as their price target to $16. They also cited many different scenarios where the stock could rise further.\nWalmart (NYSE: WMT) has partnered with MGM studios to produce exclusive content for Vudu, the streaming video-on demand service that they bought about eight years ago. The partnership is aimed at boosting viewership so they can compete more with the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Hulu. Shares were higher on the news.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to strike fear in their competitors as more and more are worried that they cannot compete directly with Amazon\u2019s expanding, private label business. The company has been growing that division more and more which can be seen as more and more of those brands show up favorably on their website. Shares were lower on the day by about 2%.\n\n\nWe're an investing service that also helps you keep your dough straight.

At the same time stock valuations are trading well above average P/E ratios we've seen historically due to massive share buybacks and record low interest rates. Donalds Trumps tax reform plan led to a huge rally in the stock market, but the FOMC is counteracting the stimulus it created by hiking interest rates rapidly, and by letting bonds roll off of the federal reserves balance sheet. As interest rates tick higher and stock markets sell off globally this leads to a very interesting market.\n\nBank Analysis:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adr4PDL2pNw\n\nThe Richest Companies on Earth:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5BUjXeW3jU", "PSX Pakistan Stock Exchange Tips and Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) Market Summary so that investors or traders of Pakistan Stock Exchange can make good money online by trading.\nGet advises about which shares to buy and which shares to sell.\nInvestors or traders of Karachi Stock Exchange can get information about KSE100 index, PSX market behavior, volume leaders shares (pivot), ups & downs in stocks and commodity shares prices. \nAlso, future prediction of Pakistan stock exchange market can be helpful for technical trading in PSX market.\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE | Like | Share | Comment your feedback or questions.\n\nOnline Trading Account Opening (request) Form:\nhttps://zafarstocks.com/pakistan-stock-exchange-trading-account-online\n\nOur Official Website: \nhttps://zafarstocks.com\n\nOn Official Facebook Page:\nhttps://web.facebook.com/zafarstocks1/\n\nOur Facebook Groups:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/ZafarSecurities/\n\nOur Instagram Profile:\nzafarstocks1\n\nOur Official Blogs:\nhttps://zafarstocks.com/daily-updates-trading-news\n\nSubscribe To Daily Email Updates:\nhttps://zafarstocks.com/subscribe-for-daily-email-updates\n\nOur Twitter Profile:\n https://twitter.com/zafarstocks\n\nGoogle+ Profile :\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ZafarStocks\n\n#PakistanStockExchangeToday #KSE100index #KarachiStockExchangeTips #KarachiStockExchange #PSX #PakistanStockExchangeToday #KSEBroker", "30 DIN MEN SAFAL STOCK MARKET INVESTOR KAISE BANE  ||\n30 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0949\u0915 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0947\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u092b\u0932 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0936\u0915 \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u0947\u0902?\n\n\n\u201c\u092a\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u0942\u092a \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0917\u093f\u0930\u0924\u093e \u092c\u0932\u094d\u0915\u093f \u095b\u092e\u0940\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u0917\u0939\u0930\u0947 \u0916\u094b\u0926\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d -\u092a\u0902\u091a\u0924\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\n\n\u092c\u0947\u0939\u0924\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092a\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0915 \u0905\u0935\u0936\u094d\u092f \u0916\u0930\u0940\u0926\u0947\u0902 \n\n30 Din Men Safal Stock Market Investor Kaise Bane ? : 30 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0949\u0915 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0947\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u092b\u0932 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0936\u0915 \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u0947\u0902 ?

No one talks about it. \nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MDNeVq to get INSTANT alerts when I post a new video outlining my penny stock trading techniques.*\n\nThe sad reality is that 90% of traders lose. 80% of my students don't even bother studying the video lessons, they just hot stock picks. So, I'm fighting the trend. \n\nYou always have to be adapting, and you always have to be testing. I wish that the stock market were an exact science. It's not. It's more of an art, and there's kind of like a moving target. So, even if you master, let's say buying earnings winners. Earnings winners might work for a week or a month or three months, and then they'll stop working. Even if you master, you know, shorting morning spikes. It might work for a week, a month, six months, and then it'll stop working. \n\nYou need to have different strategies, and this is why I have so many video lessons, DVDs, webinars. I track every single thing I do, and my top students track everything that they do. If you're a fan of my top student Tim Grittani, whose now made close to seven million, I've only made close to five million, so he's surpassed me. If you're a trading challenge student, you have over 50 archive webinars of him live trading. \n\nEven though most traders lose, guess what. There are some traders, like me and my top students, who have profited year in, year out, and we teach openly. I'm not afraid if you become profitable and I'm profitable. \n\nI know some people out there, a lot of newbies these days, are making money in a bull market. What if the bull market turns into a bear market? Are they prepared? I'd be very very very worried, learning from somebody with one, two, three years experience, because they just haven't seen it all. They're not bad people, and they're just inexperienced. And learning from inexperienced people is very very dangerous, and very risky. And you don't even know it until it's too late. \n\nIf and when the market changes, guess what, they're not prepared because they've never seen another market. I've made money in bull markets and bear markets. So, I'm not here to brag, and I'm just tryin' to explain to you the landscape. And a lot of people say, \"Tim, like why are this cocky? You haven't made this much money.\" It's not cockiness, and it's experience. I've seen the ups and the downs. I've seen real traders, I've seen fake traders, I've seen every kind of stock movement possible. \n\nSo, I'm trying to share with you, from my years of experience so that it can help you be better prepared. As I said, the stock market is a battlefield. I want to arm you with like, the best weaponry. I'm basically like your Drill Sargent, and I'm not here to be your friend. If you don't like my personality, if you get offended, if you're like the grammar police with my blog posts I don't need you, and you don't need me, the world is very big. But, if you don't care about little stuff and you're focused on like, okay. This guy knows what he's talking about, then hit me up. Message me, go to timothysykes.com. Don't trust any of these freakin' random people who say like, and I have imposters these days. \n\nPeople on different social media and they say, \"Oh, I'm Tim Sykes' student.\" No, don't learn from random people on the internet, okay? I'm sorry that there are so many imposters, that's what comes with being real. Go to timothysykes.com/contact, and I'll also post a link just below this video. If you want to learn, do me a favor and be dedicated, and don't sweat the small stuff, because I have no tolerance and no patience. \n\n* Results may not be typical and may vary from person to person.

That does not mean that it is for everyone. There are countless different approaches that one could have to the stock market, and none of them are strictly right or wrong.\nDon't ever follow exactly what any one person tells you when it comes to the stock market - including me! Do your research and come to your own conclusions. \n\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nQ. Do you day trade?\nA. Essentially, no. I rarely day trade. I think that since I have started trading, I have only done 2 or 3 day trades.\n\nQ. Your chart assumes that you can identify highs and lows - how is that possible?\nA. It's not. My chart was a very basic version of the way in which I trade - very basic. If I could re-film the video, I would put more emphasis on identifying highs and lows - the emphasis being that you can never 100% identify them. \nIf you trade, as I showed later in my chart, sometimes you will sell and the stock will skyrocket. Or, quite often, you will buy and the stock will plummet. It happens, and of course I experience this all the time.\n\nQ. How long do you hold stocks?\nA. This varies greatly, and can be anywhere from 1 day to months. On average, I probably hold stocks approximately 3 days - 1 week.\n\nQ. So, you are making this video to advise people to start trading?\nA. No. Absolutely not. I would be more likely to encourage people NOT to trade on the stock market than I would be to do vice versa. \n\nQ. So, you trade off your base of $10k, and live off of that?\nA. No. $10k is what I started with in my account two years ago. It is not what is in my account now.\n\nQ. Can you give me advice on...?\nA. No. Although I would love to help everyone, I am not the best means of advice for you. I am not trying to give anyone advice here - I am simply sharing a bit of insight into what my job as a stock trader looks like. I am not a licensed financial advisor, and I would not ever presume to give anyone financial advice. Please do your research and be careful!\n\nQ. You don't seem like a professional trader...?\nA. I am not really concerned with how professional I \"seem.\" I am making a living, and that is the most important thing to me. I did not go to school for this, or ever take any classes on the stock market. I did my own research and taught myself all that I know about the market. I am not worried about seeming professional - I am only concerned about making money on the stock market.\n\nQ. Can you give us proof / screenshot your personal account info / banking info so that I believe you?\nA. No. If you do not \"believe me,\" please don't expect me to care.\n\nQ. I want to make some quick cash. Should I invest in the stock market?\nA. No. Absolutely not.\n\nQ. Can you film yourself actually trading on the market?\nA. No - for various reasons. One, if you are imagining that my actual trading will be anywhere near as engaging as that not-very-exciting chart, you are mistaken. Perhaps if I was day trading, this would not be the case, but when I buy a stock, I simply click a button the says \"buy.\" That's it... And then I wait for days, weeks, perhaps months. There is nothing thrilling to see here.\nAlso, it would be a bother to block out all of my account numbers and all that. Sorry. \n\n\nSOCIALS \n\nInstagram - travellight21\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/travellight21/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Travellight_\nhttp://travellight.me\n\n\nWhy do I trade on TD Ameritrade?\n- They have strong research reports\n- They have great trading tools, such as Thinkorswim\n- They have a great mobile app that allows me to trade on the go\n- They have amazing customer service\n- There are no hidden fees, such as maintaining a minimum balance\n\nI explained this in the original cut of my video, but it was just getting too long!\n\n**And no, I am not sponsored in any way by TD Ameritrade, I just like their trading platform and wanted to give you guys an explanation of why that is. A lot of people also highly recommend Scottrade, which has lower fees than Ameritrade. Whatever works for you!**\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis video is for entertainment purposes only.

Bitcoin and other top-50 altcoins were little changed in value. Bitcoin, in particular, continued its consolidation below the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo\u2019s cloud on the daily chart, inside a triangle chart pattern. A break above or below the triangle or the thinning future Ichimoku cloud could confirm the direction of Bitcoin\u2019s value in October. In other news, Bitfinex, one of the leading crypto exchanges for active traders is reportedly now banking with HSBC  \u201c through a private account of Global Trading Solutions.\u201d Bitfinex used to bank with the US-based Wells Fargo but ended up suing it in April 2017   the bank blocked deposits to Bitfinex and disrupted its operations. If Bitfinex can sustain its partnership with HSBC, it may have a positive impact on the exchange and the crypto market as a whole. Among last week\u2019s other hot topics was the America brokerage firm, TD Ameritrade who invested in ErisX, a crypto-related futures market that will integrate Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin along with Bitcoin. But even this news didn\u2019t do much to move the crypto prices. The week ahead may bring more volatility to the cryptocurrency market, so plan your strategies in advance, invest responsibly, and subscribe for more updates.", "Mission Update - Colin Stone, Blockchain Braveheart\n\nGet your daily dose of Apollo and cryptocurrency news and updates! \n\nViamana - https://vimana.global/\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nApollo Foundation\n\nThe World's first all-in-one cryptocurrency incorporating every useful feature utilized in top-tier currencies and combining those with unmatched privacy, all in a single decentralized platform.\n\nCome to our website: https://www.apollocurrency.com/\n___________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out our social media presence and engage with fellow #apollonauts\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Apolloprivac...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ApolloCurrency\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/apollocurre...\nTelegram: https://t.me/apollocommunity\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/2sFKWgz", "Quarter 4 is here and XRapid just launched commercially.

It's up to you to take the necessary steps before buying cryptocurrency to ensure the security of your investments.\n\nCryptocurrency is cutting-edge technology, it\u2019s the modern day wild wild west, so it requires some focused time and energy to wrap your head around. \n\nLuckily for you, I\u2019ve done a lot of the leg work to compile this step-by-step guide to ensure you receive the knowledge and understanding you need to be successful in cryptocurrency investments.\n\nIn this step-by-step video, you will be walked through the process of setting up passwords, new email accounts, 2-factor authentication apps, wallets, malware protection, and all the essential steps you need to take to protect yourself.\n\nAlways remember the golden rule of investing: NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose. High risk can lead high reward and we humans have a natural tendency to want to overreach.\n\nBut you need to figure out an amount you are comfortable investing and, more importantly, an amount you can truly afford to invest - then you need to stick with that amount and be patient in the process.\n \nCryptocurrency is a lot more volatile and unpredictable than the stock market. Unlike the 9 to 5 New York stock exchange, cryptocurrency is traded around the world 24/7. \n\nSo if you want to get a good night\u2019s sleep as a crypto investor, you need to budget the amount of money you are going to invest and stick to it.\n\nYou will learn how to buy cryptocurrency in 10 easy steps.

Where will it start? When will it start? What impact will it have, and how will the world look after the global economic crisis and the Next Great Recession?\n\nRegarding how it will play out, Cezary Graf notes that Trump and Federal Reserve policy will lead to financial collapse around the world. The economic collapse has already started. The Turkish lira is plunging, the Argentinian central bank has increased interest rates to the cosmic level of 60%, and Iranian inflation is skyrocketing.\n\nHowever, these are minor players. The crucial years will be 2019 and 2020 when the deadly cocktail will be served for India, Pakistan, China, Japan, and the European Union, among others. In 2020, the United States and the dollar will also be hit; however, the magnitude will be significantly limited, in contrast to what many are currently saying about the upcoming dollar collapse. In 2022, after the next global financial crisis, the United States will be in the best shape of all major countries. I am ready to take bets.\n\nIt is very naive to expect that after the 2000 dot-com bubble burst and 2008-2009 economic collapse, that the third one will again start in the US.\n\nFrom a conservative point of view, the US currency and bond supply are perhaps still too high, and rates may still be too low, however, despite its peculiarity, the dollar and US debt are the most popular US exports.\nDuring the next two years, when major emerging markets will be struck by various crises, we will have massive capital flows into the US. This will include the dollar itself, the US bond market, the US stock market, and US real\nestate.\n\nTwo major trends can be expected:\n\n1 - A massive human migration crisis. Emerging market countries' citizens will be displaced because of economic reasons. And yet again, the US under the Trump administration will manage it relatively well.\n\n2 - A massive chunk of the capital pulled out of emerging markets will be channeled to the most robust cryptocurrencies. The devaluation of EM currencies, the dismantling of the SWIFT system, and the pursuit of new investment solutions by private, corporate, and public parties will be the main causes of this great money migration.\n\nCezary Graf states that the value of cryptocurrencies will rise substantially from mid-2018 levels, thus making potential returns from other capital allocations much less attractive. Ignoring this is the manifestation of a deep misunderstanding of where the world is now and where it is going.\n\nThis will be the first crisis with the crypto option on the table.\n\nWhat is a 'Cryptocurrency'\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. A cryptocurrency is difficult to counterfeit because of this security feature. A defining feature of a cryptocurrency and arguably its most endearing allure is its organic nature; it is not issued by any central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\nCryptocurrency Benefits and Drawbacks\nCryptocurrencies make it easier to transfer funds between two parties in a transaction; these transfers are facilitated through the use of public and private keys for security purposes. These fund transfers are done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by most banks and financial institutions for wire transfers.\n\nMusic: CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nCezary Graf\n\nPL: http://CezaryGraf.pl\nEN: http://CezaryGraf.com\n\nLINKED IN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezarygraf\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/cezarygrafcryptopoland\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/cryptopoland\nBANDCAMP: https://cezarygraf.bandcamp.com\n\nE-MAIL: i n f o {([at])} c e z a r y g r a f . p l", "Anda siap Mengubah Hidup Anda? \nBagaimana seandainya Anda bisa:\n\ud83d\udc4dMenjadi Bos atas diri sendiri? \n\ud83d\udc4dMenentukan jam kerja anda sendiri? \n\ud83d\udc4dMeluangkan lebih banyak waktu dengan keluarga dan teman? \n\ud83d\udc4dBebas menentukan seberapa banyak uang yg anda hasilkan? \n\nPILIHAN DITANGAN ANDA!. \n\u261dBatasi Impian anda agar sesuai dg penghasilan anda saat ini.\n                 ATAU\n\u270cTingkatkan pendapatan anda untuk mewujudkan Impian anda.\n\nLuangkan 12 menit waktu anda untuk menyimak video ini.\n\nDaftar gratis disini:\nhttps://onecoin.eu/signup/BALIBAGUS01\natau\nhttps://onecoin.eu/signup/BALIBAGUS03", "This market trading analysis applies to various exchanges, including Bitmex and Binance.

Cryptocurrencies, ICOs, blockchain, and altcoin investing offers new crypto entrants a high risk, high reward strategy that has the potential to net them untold riches or mire them in loss and despair. The savvy cryptocurrency investor looks for undervalued altcoins, and crypto projects that have a greater ROI relative to more established rivals such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ripple. Coin Bloq will consider the merits and potential obstacles of altcoin investing and asks whether the markets they seek to serve are non-existent or over-saturated. \n\nCrypto investing is littered with new and exotic sounding terms - tokenize this, blockchain that, etc. No wonder new investors gasp in desperation as they try to understand the incomprehensible! Each week, Coin Bloq looks at six competing cryptocurrency projects and asks whether they actually solve a problem, whilst comparing them to previous crypto projects. Supply and demand, basic economics and a sound understanding of market psychology are all taken into account and investigated by Coin Bloq. \n\n_______________________________________\nVideo Content:\n\n00:03 Introduction \n\n00:38 What is NEO?\n\n03:38 Strengths\n\n07:23 Weaknesses\n\n11:40 Opportunities\n\n16:12 Threats\n\n19:59 Conclusion - Remedies and Solutions: Decentralization, Clarity and Leadership\n_______________________________________\nFOLLOW Coin Bloq:\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udc49Coin Bloq\u2019s Alerts Group: https://t.me/CoinBloqAlerts\n\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc49 Coin Bloq\u2019s Telegram Group: https://t.me/CoinBloqGroup\n\ud83d\udcf1 \ud83d\udc49Coin Bloq\u2019s Twitter: https://twitter.com/CoinBloq\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udc49 Coin Bloq\u2019s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/coinbloq/\n\n_______________________________________\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nThis is not financial advice.

Where will it start? When will it start? What impact will it have, and how will the world look after the global economic crisis and the Next Great Recession?\n\nRegarding how it will play out, Cezary Graf notes that Trump and Federal Reserve policy will lead to financial collapse around the world. The economic collapse has already started. The Turkish lira is plunging, the Argentinian central bank has increased interest rates to the cosmic level of 60%, and Iranian inflation is skyrocketing.\n\nHowever, these are minor players. The crucial years will be 2019 and 2020 when the deadly cocktail will be served for India, Pakistan, China, Japan, and the European Union, among others. In 2020, the United States and the dollar will also be hit; however, the magnitude will be significantly limited, in contrast to what many are currently saying about the upcoming dollar collapse. In 2022, after the next global financial crisis, the United States will be in the best shape of all major countries. I am ready to take bets.\n\nIt is very naive to expect that after the 2000 dot-com bubble burst and 2008-2009 economic collapse, that the third one will again start in the US.\n\nFrom a conservative point of view, the US currency and bond supply are perhaps still too high, and rates may still be too low, however, despite its peculiarity, the dollar and US debt are the most popular US exports.\nDuring the next two years, when major emerging markets will be struck by various crises, we will have massive capital flows into the US. This will include the dollar itself, the US bond market, the US stock market, and US real\nestate.\n\nTwo major trends can be expected:\n\n1 - A massive human migration crisis. Emerging market countries' citizens will be displaced because of economic reasons. And yet again, the US under the Trump administration will manage it relatively well.\n\n2 - A massive chunk of the capital pulled out of emerging markets will be channeled to the most robust cryptocurrencies. The devaluation of EM currencies, the dismantling of the SWIFT system, and the pursuit of new investment solutions by private, corporate, and public parties will be the main causes of this great money migration.\n\nCezary Graf states that the value of cryptocurrencies will rise substantially from mid-2018 levels, thus making potential returns from other capital allocations much less attractive. Ignoring this is the manifestation of a deep misunderstanding of where the world is now and where it is going.\n\nThis will be the first crisis with the crypto option on the table.\n\nWhat is a 'Cryptocurrency'\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. A cryptocurrency is difficult to counterfeit because of this security feature. A defining feature of a cryptocurrency and arguably its most endearing allure is its organic nature; it is not issued by any central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\nCryptocurrency Benefits and Drawbacks\nCryptocurrencies make it easier to transfer funds between two parties in a transaction; these transfers are facilitated through the use of public and private keys for security purposes. These fund transfers are done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by most banks and financial institutions for wire transfers.\n\nMusic: CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nCezary Graf\n\nPL: http://CezaryGraf.pl\nEN: http://CezaryGraf.com\n\nLINKED IN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezarygraf\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/cezarygrafcryptopoland\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/cryptopoland\nBANDCAMP: https://cezarygraf.bandcamp.com\n\nE-MAIL: i n f o {([at])} c e z a r y g r a f . p l", "Hey Altcoin Daily Team,\n\nIn this video, I will convince you, without a shadow of a doubt, why HODLing is the best cryptocurrency investment strategy.

What was it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you clicked on this to read the rest, congratulations. You have just learned how your attention is easily controlled by creating a mystery. Our focus remains on something until it is resolved. If not resolved, we tend to keep thinking about it. Hence why we stay awake in bed at night, and constantly check our phone or email, or what have you, waiting for that response we just _know_ is coming.\n\nSo now that we have went through that, and you probably weren't completely focused on it, because you were wondering what the one thing was that prevented Pavlov's dogs from salivating, let's get into what it was:\n\nChanging the environment. When conditions were the same, the dogs would salivate. Yet, when the environment had been altered, the bell had no effect. This is because what is salient in our brains becomes the focal point, and takes on more attention and importance. The bell became less important than the new surroundings.\n\nSo, how can we use this to help us fall asleep better without the distractions of our phone? It's truly as simple as leaving your phone in another room. Just by walking through the door into your bedroom, you are subconsciously changing the focus of your mind, because the entire environment changes. \n\nAnd how can we prevent classical conditioning from advertisements? Set goals. There is a reason goal setting is so powerful for entrepreneurs...and it can be for everyone else as well. By setting goals, and reading them twice daily, first thing when you wake up, and last thing before you go to bed; you are setting in your mind the focus and attention for the entire day, the most important things. And as such, you tend not to be distracted by ads as easily, since they will only distract you from your goals. When you know your goals, and the direction your life is going, anything that isn't a part of that plan becomes irrelevant, and unimportant. You tend not to fall for impulse buying, or persuasive advertising the same. And the things that can help you achieve your goals, become more prevalent in advertising...and those typically aren't bad things to consider purchasing anyways.", "Niiiice", "Bro pls next time don't use Iron to record your voice.

Once I have a tooth brush, I don't need a commercial to tell me to buy one, and if I haven't got one, I am smart enough to find one, so it is totally pointless to pollute tons of air in both broadcasting toothbrush commercials as well as making them.

The main question was: How much was your (the customer/respondent) last consumer purchase influenced by an advertisement 1) Heavily influenced 2) Somewhat influenced 3) Minimally influenced 4) Not influenced at all. As I recall, the stats went something like this 1) Heavily influenced, 12% 2) Somewhat influenced 29% 3) Minimally influenced 35% 4) Not influenced at all 19% \nNow, the responses are somewhat subjective, what constitutes heavy or minimal influence for one person can mean something entirely different for someone else. However, when more than 40% of respondents reported a subtantial influence on their shopping habits through advertising, that makes the endeavor more than worth the money spent. \nSo, ads aren't going anywhere...since, as intrusive and annoying as they can be, they seem to work."], ["Who said patanjali is not advertising . haven't u turn your TV screen.

I am reading and learning about stock market through your channel.\n\nI watched option play list two times Still i dont understand simple logic of options.\n\nIt is very confusing to me. please read my doubt and clear it sir.\n\nAssume an stock price 90 RS. \nStrike price 100 Rs\nPremium price is 3 Rs\n\nFrom the below Example (NSE website) i understood like, we can earn profit only if the stock price rises above 103 Rs. (Strike price+premium price)\n\n  Mr. XYZ is bullish on Nifty on 24th June, when the Nifty is at 4191.10. He buys a call option with a strike price of Rs. 4600 at a premium of Rs. 36.35, expiring on 31st July. If the Nifty goes above 4636.35, Mr. XYZ will make a net profit (after deducting the premium) on exercising the option. In case the Nifty stays at or falls below 4600, he can forego the option (it will expire worthless) with a maximum loss of the premium.   \n\nBut from our subscribers comments as well as option playlist videos, I understood like if the stock price rises from 90 Rs. Then we can see little movement in the premium value (Lets say for example stock price rose to 95 Rs. And current premium became 3.5 Rs )\nthat can be booked as profit.\n\nI dont know i explained well enough.\nHope you understand my doubt sir.\n\nPlease clear If you understood  sir.", "Nandri\ud83d\udc4d", "gd n8 bro", "Shipping company also doing business in dollars", "Hi Muthu kumar.sir, \n\n I have been investing in Adithya Brilla sun life pure value fund Growth fund for.past 1 year ,  I have expected 15 % return but past 1 absl pure value fund performance was not good nearly 20% loss  , Nav been below 52 week low , shall I continue my absl , wt ur1 opinion ... pls suggest me sir", "Sgx nifty mathiri  video poruga sir", "Stock market daily news updates sir", "very useful message nanba..", "Tq bro", "swing trading screener sollunga anna", "Hi bro \nMotherson sumi announces bonus 1:2 on Sep 7, \nBut haven\u2019t released yet.\nIf we buy then eligible for bonus.\nPls clarify more detail abt bonus \nThanks", "Hi Muthu bro, en frnds kuluku stock market pathi theriunjukanum ne enaku solli kudu nu sonanga na unga channel ah refer Panen.

These stocks can be easily bought and sold on the Internet. So the general public can buy and sell pieces of ownership in the underlying companies. \n\nThe stock price is determined by people's estimate of the value of the underlying company they're buying. The value of the underlying company is based on how much money the company will make from selling its products. \n\nSo if a company is worth $100 million and it has 100 million shares, then each share is worth $1.00. \n\nBut no one in the market knows that it's worth $1.00 for sure because no one knows definitively how much money a company will make in the future. Right? No one can predict the future, so no one knows the price for sure. \n\nSo people do their analysis hoping to buy the stock at a price lower than what the company's worth (that way they get more money than what they paid for). But people's assessments change over time, so they might increase / decrease what they're willing to pay.

BUY.\n\n5. \u26fd The government plans to blend LPG with methanol in order to reduce the cost of home cylinders. BUY Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Indian Oil Corporation.

Pag madami ka nang nabiling shares, mas malaki ang DIVIDEND at GAIN na mkukuha, kaya important na continues investment, self discipline tlga ang pag-iinvest. Hindi kailangan na 1 time big time investment(mabigat yun otherwise yayamanin ka na to start! ), mas ok ang monthly may alotted kang itinatabi for investement (i set aside m na pagka-sweldo). Yes, I choose long term investment, kya ganto ang comment ko po. =) . Atleast 2k monthly pwede ka na invest, kung afford m ang higher amount mas ok. Depende parin sa investor kung how much ang kaya at gano ka-frequent ang pag invest, if monthly, every other month, quarter or annual or 1 tym lng.  Beating the inflation din ang logic ng investment s stock. Marami factors affects the price value ng stocks like, company expansion, operation, partnership,  yung mismong economy natin and more.. Pero basically how it works, Buy low, sell high. When price is LOW, consider it sale kaya time to buy, buy, buy atleast monthly. If price is high most likely time to sell naman. Pero pano malalaman, e bka tataas pa? sayang if click kagad ang sell.. I use Truly Rich Club as my guide in stock market investment. At least to know if the price is LOW and time to BUY, or HIGH and time to HOLD muna or SELL na ba? Di mo n kelangan mgpaka trying hard-analyst/expert at mapraning anu nangyyari sa company bkit puro pababa ang price or kelan b dapat ibenta bka bigla bumagsak if inaantay mong tumaas pa, coz they have analyst that do the job and simplified things for u, via articles, company updates, stock updates, etc sent via email.

Most investors and traders should not be fearful of HFT algos and trading. The effects of HFT are better for individuals because we are constantly getting priced improved, as HFT firms compete for our order flow. The times that we should be fearful of HFT is when they decide to leave and liquidity dries up. This would mean that there is no longer any bids/offers to help offload our positions when the time to is crucial.\n\nThe argument that HFTs do not have skin in the game is also incorrect. Unless they are spoofing (which is illegal), they are providing liquidity to the market. This means they are constantly playing between the bid-ask and trying to collect their piece in the value creation in the process. It is no different than aspects of real estate and people taking their share. I would rather that I have to give up .01 spread so that the HFT can get their .01 to get the position on that I want, than pay .05-.10 (OR MORE) spreads in market dynamics like Lewis is advocating for. Algorithms are searching the market for what their models declare as inefficiencies or mispricings as well. They are willing to build a position that the model claims is mis-priced, which they will quickly offload when the situation presents itself.

We will both have to wait a couple of months until they come back to the surface. The difference is, I will still get a 4.1%, while your money is sitting there idle. During the market gyrations of the past weeks, I had the feeling dividend stocks were performing better; they showed more resistance to the downturn.

That is why my explanations are extremely basic. I understand that they do not fully convey the nuances of the stock market. \"Buy low, sell high,\" sounds exaggeratedly simplistic, but that is what I was going for.\nThis wasn't a video to share a secret strategy. This wasn't a video to educate. \nIt was an answer to an often-asked question, that being - \"How do you afford to travel?\"\nThis was the answer - and that's all the purpose that there was to making this video. \n\nI am highly disappointed to see countless videos being uploaded by men that are, frankly, lies and attempts to swindle viewers into handing over money. Buy their book and you'll be successful on the stock market. Buy their tutorials and you'll get rich. Some of them even go so far as to use lines such as \"Let's make these people millionaires,\" or \"You will not fail with my strategy, 100% guaranteed.\" \nThey are met with applause and little skepticism. Even those that are not convinced into handing over money to them still comment with appreciation and respect. \nThere are far fewer women on Wall Street than men - and this is not due to men being any more predisposed to success on the stock market than women. It is due to a pervading inequality that colors impressions before a woman even enters a board meeting, or says a word on CNBC. Already, viewers are forming their first impression of her with unconscious (or, in varying degrees, perhaps quite conscious) thoughts along the lines of \"SHE trades? Let's see what she says before I'll believe that...\" or \"She's too young / pretty / blonde / girly to be on the stock market.\" \nIn actuality, the stock market is made up of - to strip it down to its essence - numbers. Numbers in green, or red. These numbers do not come accompanied by white men in suits and cigars and scotch. They are not ushered in by a Harvard graduate as an uneducated man looks on. They are not concerned with age, or how blonde a woman's hair is, or where someone went to college, or sharp suits or Manhattan penthouses. \nThey are numbers and numbers only.

They might be brokers losing commisions, or those idiots who thought they were smart enough to day trade and lost all their money, or those who are being taken advantage by their brokers and keep being told the markets are only for the experience MBA class.\nYour description was how you trade on the stock market, it didn't say anything about advanced strategies for trading, or options trading, high frequency trading, I'm not sure why all these beta males are hating on you. Your video is a simple introduction to trading, but for many they are not aware of even the basics. Buy low, sell high.\nI'm not a day trader, I'm more of a swing trader I hold onto my options positions for a few weeks.\nI trade using think or swim, and Robinhood. I use a few other apps to track stocks. I don't feel many need to have much to start with, what they do need is the understanding of the trading terms, how to use the trading broker platform, and what to look for, meaning volume, momentum, speculation.\nI recently made a few option positions one with \nCGC I bought 8 calls at\n.25 each so a total of $200, in about 3 weeks I sold each contract at 4.15, it was a good investment. \nThe other position was I bought a few puts with tesla, and dollar tree and we'll it went in my favor.\nAnd yes I made those trades using Robinhood while at work on my phone. I use TOS to check charts, I use Yahoo Finance, Webull to research companies. Webull is good to use for finding out about upcoming IPO's, market gainers, market losers. It helps me to figure out how to make a position. \nWith CGC it was on Yahoo news about how much money was being invested with cgc that made me think it might be good to make a small investment. \nSo yeah like you said everyone needs to find their own strategy, don't listen to others who want to charge you for the simple stuff, basics. If you're going to spend money, buy books to understand the basics. I personally don't recommend doing hft, because over a longer period of about 4 weeks you can make that same amount without the unneeded stress. \nI also invest in Bank of America, Sun Trust bank, Intuitive Surgical, for the dividends but it's usually to keep it in there till I find another position I want to invest in, these companies have a good history of maintaining gains, so its like an account within my account.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0e", "Just a FYI to the public.

I like to think of it as a combination of both Robinhood and Acorns. If I had to choose only one app to use to invest in the stock market, I would definitely pick M1 Finance. (They also allow you to open a ROTH IRA!)\n\nTry it today and get $10 to invest!\u00a0http://mbsy.co/ll87Q\n\nI also buy publicly traded companies via an app called Robinhood.

You simply connect your bank account with Coinbase to start buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptos, which you can send to anyone in the world just like you would an email.\n\nIt\u2019s free to create a Coinbase digital wallet, plus you can get $10 worth of BTC for free if you use my link below!\n\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/join/591a24ce64a015071bf549c7\n\nAnother way to earn cryptocurrency is to mine it. You essentially leave your computer on and earn crypto by allowing the various cryptocurrency networks to use your computer's processing power to confirm transactions.\u00a0 This is essentially a free way to earn cryptocurrency though there are the costs of electricity for letting your computer run.\u00a0 The program I use for this that is the most simple is called Honeyminer.\u00a0 With honeyminer, all mined coins are converted to Bitcoin and your balance will increase daily.\u00a0 You can keep it as an investment or sell it for cash anytime you want.\u00a0 Signup with my referral link and you will receive a nice bitcoin bonus immediately for signing up!\u00a0https://honeyminer.com/referred/593p5\u00a0If you sign up without a referral link you'll start with $0 so might as well take the bonus!\n\nBut if cryptos aren't your thing, and you'd like to become rich fast you should start a business!

Timing the market is incredibly difficult and I think staying in the market is more important. Don't get me wrong I love going red for a bit because I just load up more but if you are constantly going in and out of the market you will pay more taxes if your gains are not long term (that is assuming you make any money) and you miss out on all of the dividends that you get while the market is down which reinvested just buys more shares at a discount!

The person who PERFECTLY timed the market every year, ended up with $87,000 in 2013, while the investor who bought at the top of the market every year (worst possible timing) ended up with $72,000.

factors_*\n\n*Rupee at record low*:\u00a0A falling rupee weighed heavy on investor sentiment. The local currency plunged to its fresh record low of 73.77 against the dollar early Thursday. The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever. The dollar index stood tall against other currencies, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.\n\n\u201cDollar dominated the last 24 hours as the rupee collapsed to a fresh all-time low on spot. Policymakers tried everything, monetary intervention, and verbal steroids and even tried to circulate rumours about an \"oil window\". Nothing worked. The RBI added fuel to fire by denying any attempts to introduce special dollar window for the oil marketing companies. Oil was on the boil, local equity and bond markets were under the hammer. If that was not enough, rising Italian credit spreads whacked the euro, further pressuring the rupee,\u201d Kotak Securities said in a report.\n\n*Boiling oil*:\u00a0Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel in morning deals while WTI crude was above $76 per barrel. Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities, said, \u201cMarket has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.\u201d\n\n*Rising bond yields*:\u00a0Hardening bond yields are creating waves of panic in the domestic equity market. India\u2019s 10-year bond yield was hovering above 8.18 per cent on Thursday against previous close of 8.11 per cent. Bond yields have spiked 84 basis points on a year-to-date basis.\n\n*Foreign capital outflows*:\u00a0Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far. They sold shares worth Rs 1,488.96 crore in September. However, their net investment stood at Rs 262.72 crore in August, as per data available with depository NSDL.\n\nAccording to the data released by the NSE, FIIs were net sellers of Rs 2,056.87 crore in index futures and options segments, according to Wednesday\u2019s data. FIIs were net sellers of index futures to the tune of Rs 699.54 crore and net sellers of index options worth Rs 1357.33 crore.\n\n*US Treasury yields* reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note's yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs after economic data on Wednesday bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December and beyond.\n\n*Weak Asian* cues:\u00a0Subdued Asian markets spoiled market sentiment too. Japan's Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Thursday morning as investors took profit from its recent rally to a 27-year high while automakers and technology heavyweights took limelight on news of technology tie-ups for self-driving cars. Nikkei225 was trading 0.46 per cent down at 23,999 while Hang Seng came down over 1.50 per cent at 26,628.64.", "Muthu brother. Gap up and Gap down vachi BTST or STBT panna mudiyuma?

And $100 (hundred dollars) in Ethereum has increased to as high as $66,290 in under two years! The trend is on a daily increase, worldwide, investors in crypto and digital currencies are getting rich daily, I personally have invested in bitcoin and Ethereum. And I've collected bigger gains investing these coins than in anything else in my life. For example, I bought bitcoin twice, last year and early this year, 10 coins at $83.40. And 20 more at $128. Today my 20 coins trade nearly 24 times higher . And I also bought Ethereum last November at $9.70... before it rocketed to $355! I was up over 3,500%. But here is the thing nobody is talking about, bitcoin and Ethereum aren't the real success stories anymore. It's the smaller and unpopular new digital currencies that are rewarding investors with the next round of huge wins. For example , I recently obtained 27,000 coins in a tiny new digital currency for just 18.5 cents per coin. Those coins now trade for around $4 each- 1,981% higher. And I invested in another one that's jumped from $1.50 to $10.71. Yet this opportunity is just getting started, today I'll show you the new digital currencies that can turn as little as $10 into over $1million. in the blink of an eye. Yes, that's right. a single crispy $10 bill could make you a millionaire. now for the doubters, not only is it possible, it's actually happening right now, a considerable number of investors worldwide have seen gains of 75,063% in Cryptonite, 59,577% in InfluxCoin, 60,450% in MaxCoin, and even 823,750% in DubaiCoin! Tiny new digital currencies are offering profits far bigger than bitcoin and much more quickly, I've personally made over 600% in one digital currency more than 1,981 in a second and over 3,500% in another, and I expect to make a whole lot more. Digital currencies is now one of the online investments where you can start with $10 and turn that into real money fast. CNBC did a story about a high school dropout who bought some bitcoin at $12 and is now a millionaire. also top investors worldwide are going all in on the new digital currencies. Now this is what you guys should know . A new set of coins are being launched now that could help you turn as little as $10 into over $1 million. I've never seen profit opportunities like this before in any market and at anytime. For example, in one recent week 23 separate digital currencies doubled in value. By comparison, the S&P 500 hasn't seen a single stock double yet this year. But only those who recognize the opportunity right now will see the fast profits. I first got in on Bitcoin at $83.40 and $128... only to watch it soar to over $2,000. But now I've turned my attention to the new digital currencies. For example; I invested in ANTSHARES earlier this year and at the time it was trading for just $1.50 but I watched it climb to $10.71 in less than a month. I invested in tiny new digital currencies of 12 coins and I cashed out 12,000 at $3.50 but still hold the rest... nearly $100,000 in total. There are now dozens of small digital currencies trading for just a few cents that are moving up dramatically over very short periods; like Asch traded for few cents at first but in less than 3 months $100=$,570. NolimitCoin traded for few cents but now $100=5,348 in 6 days. MediterraneanCoin traded for few cents but now $100=8,313 in 3 months, the list is endless. I will stop here so I don't bore you guys, but it is sure worth your time. in case you are interested in venturing into investing in Crypto and Digital Currencies, or perhaps you are trading them but you don't understand what you are doing, feel free to contact via email and be sure to get free guide on any information you may need to invest in these new and unpopular crypto and digital currencies that are making waves at the moment.\n*Email/Hangout: reneestones05@gmail.com", "As an anime nerd *seeing Justin Y's* comment in this video...

I didn't use stop loss and it wasn't risky because if I get liquidated I would lose only $20-30 of $1000 so it wasn't big deal! Note: I wasn't using stop loss but I was selling in loss if I see that it will go against me! So, if I get liquidated it wasn't big loss but I had bigger problem! How to recover that loss? I had to make gain of 2% with 50x leverage to recover so it wasn't so easy in this slow market but for me it wasn't big deal I recovered loss with 1-3 trades! \n\nSo, it was safe strategy but on the other side not so profitable! It wasn't easy to make high gain! But I was making more tha 20% sometimes per day so I can't say it was bad!\n\nSo, this was bad risk reward system!\n\nI put 10% of $1000 ( so $100 ) with high leverage ( 50x ) with stop loss $30-50 from my entry price! For most of you this will sound stupid but let me explain!\nFirst, to use this strategy you have to be able to find good entry point but I will show you that this can work even without that!\nLet's say that you went long at price of $10 000 and your stop loss is at 9950! Let's say it is going against you! Your stop loss will be reached and you will lose around 2.5% of your account + 0.1-0.2 fees so around 2.7% up to 3%.\nLet's say you opened one more time same positing and you lost one more time 3%\nLet's say you opened one more position and you are in loss again!\nSo 3 positions and you lost around 8%. \nNot good? \nBut if you know anything about trading you will open good positing sometimes!\nYou opened positing at $10 000 and you have stop loss at 9950. Current price is at  10 100 so it is 1% up ( It is profit of 5% on your whole account ).\nYou will move your stop loss at 10 050 to secure your profit and you will \" ride the wave \". What will happen if price goes to 10 300 or 10 500? It is huge profit for you and you can keep riding the wave just moving your stop loss up! \n\nSo only 1 position of 4 is enough to make you profit!\n25% success rate could be enough for you!\nBut what if you have 50% or even more? Just think about that!\n\nWhat are advantages of this strategy?!\n1) It is very safe! With tight stop loss it won't make you huge loss! Also you have to discipline yourself! You are not allowed to add more money into existing position! Do not move your stop loss more down because you think it must go up! If you think it must go up but you expect small drop before then wait for that drop and open positing there! Do not rush to be in position!\nSo you can lose 2% and it is not big problem! You can even make 10 wrong trades and be in 20% loss but with one good trade you will recover everything if price reaches only 4% from entry point!!!\n\n2) It is very profitable! With high leverage and big position even gain of 1% means 5% profit on your whole account! It is huge guys! With single position!\nI am opening mostly 10-20 scalps per day if BTC i volatile enough so it means you can make HUGE gain without big risk because of tight stop loss!\n\nI hope you got some ideas and value! I will keep updating this strategy and try to improve it but this is very good and it works for me and so many of my friends.\ncontact me on richard.thompsonn004@gmail.com and i'll show you where,when and how to use the strategy", "Good thinking sir ji", "Pagal hai kya be rk help ya ghanta", "loog daar rahy hain koi be invest nahi kar raha hai or yeh video bana kar paisa bana raha hai", "Sir ji Brest cancer me Natura bioscience ka Noni natura aswaghandha v Vita bloo,do, or DTGL ka detox spray do Gajab result milege,.

Why does it happen in Q4 all the time and why is it shit before Q4? My theory is that at the end of the year investors come along who want to invest. But not the investors that you might think.. not only rich bank people who dont know what to do with their money. It's also normal companies... alot of normal companies. Because at the end of the year in most cases companies have to pay taxes and tell how much money they have at hand. The more money they have at the end of the year the higher are the taxes. So what do they do? Buy shit. Cars, houses, boats, whatever. And some go into crypto because why not? Crypto is looking good and why not invest a lil bit into that? Less taxes and less stuff to declare. And why does it go down after that? Maybe because you gotta keep that money untouched for 1 year in most countries to take it back without having to pay taxes. So people invest and the people who invested a year before that sell their stuff but probably not all of it bc why should they. Like i said it's looking good. And why is it always reaching a higher peak than the year before? Bc there are more people investing into crypto than in the year before. So that would also explain why i dont think that bitcoin is going to reach an absurd price like 1 million dollars. Just because at some point BTC is just going to be known by everyone. There wont be new investors who havent tried investng before. There are some obviously but not as many in the years before. And im telling you we will have at least 5 more bullruns.

In the case of Rolls Royce, until their suppliers also accept crypto there is no way to stop these sell offs as the company needs to keep selling cars. Our market price needs to contract more, favorably resulting in a more stable 1%-2% change per day. Then becoming more valuable (due to scarcity). But we will have to wait a bit longer for your average companies to join ship.\nOn the futures topic, back when we seen the bitcoin futures. All of the bad coins got caught out by the short seekers. People should understand that shorting gives people, profit when they find the 'shit coins'. But as soon as there are less shit coins about the bitcoin brand becomes a lot safer and overall stronger. Keep this in mind for the upcoming Ethereum. Including the ICO's that accepted Eth as funding are now under the cush! There will be more people looking to short what they believe is bad.

Just $10 7 years ago will be worth $7.5 million today and $100 in Ethereum has increased to as $66,290 in under two years ! There are stories everywhere of people getting rich. I personally invested in bitcoin and Ethereum. And I've collected bigger gains here than in anything else in my life. For example, I bought Bitcoin twice . 10 coins at $83.40. And 20 more at $128. Today my 20 coins trade nearly 24 times higher . And I also bought Ethereum last November at $9.70... before it rocketed to $355! I was up over 3,500%. But here is the thing nobody is talking about. Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't the real stories anymore. It's the smaller , lesser known NEW digital currencies that are rewarding investors with the next round of huge wins. For example , I recently obtained 27,000 coins in a tiny new digital currency for just 18.5 cents per coin. Those coins now trade for around $4 each- 1,981% higher. And I invested in another one that's jumped from $1.50 to $10.71. Yet this opportunity is just getting started . Today I'll show you the new digital currencies that can turn as little as $10 into over $1million... in the blink of an eye. Yes, that's right... a single crisp of $10 bill could make you a millionaire. It's not only possible... it's actually happening right now . Consider , investors have seen gains of... 75,063% in Cryptonite, 59,577% in InfluxCoin, 60,450% in MaxCoin, and even 823,750% in DubaiCoin! Tiny new digital currencies are offering profits far bigger than bitcoin and much more quickly. I've personally made over 600% in one digital currency more than 1,981 in a second and over 3,500% in another, and I expect to make a whole lot more. Digital currencies are the one place in the markets where you can start with $10 and turn that into real money fast. CNBC did a story on a high school dropout who bought Bitcoin at $12 and is now a millionaire. And the top investors in the world are going all in on the new digital currencies. Now this is what you guys out there should know . A new set of coins are being launched now that could help you turn as little as $10 into over $1 million. I've never seen profit opportunities like this before... in any market and at anytime. For example... in one recent week 23 separate digital currencies doubled in value. By comparison, the S&P 500 hasn't seen a single stock double yet this year. But only those who recognize the opportunity right now will see the fast profits. I first got in on Bitcoin at $83.40 and $128... only to watch it soar to over $5,000. But now I've turned my attention to the new digital currencies. For example; I invested in ANTSHARES earlier this year and at the time it was trading for just $1.50 but I watched it climb to $10.71 in less than a month. I invested in tiny new digital currencies of 12 coins and I cashed out 20,000 at $5.50 but still hold the rest... nearly $100,000 in total. There are now dozens of small digital currencies trading for just a few cents that are moving up dramatically over very short periods; like Asch traded for few cents at first but in less than 3 months $100=$,570. NolimitCoin traded for few cents but now $200=5,348 in 6 days. MediterraneanCoin traded for few cents but now $200=8,313 in 3 months.

Just $10 7 years ago will be worth $7.5 million today and $100 in Ethereum has increased to as $66,290 in under two years ! There are stories everywhere of people getting rich. I personally invested in bitcoin and Ethereum. And I've collected bigger gains here than in anything else in my life. For example, I bought Bitcoin twice . 10 coins at $83.40. And 20 more at $128. Today my 20 coins trade nearly 24 times higher . And I also bought Ethereum last November at $9.70... before it rocketed to $355! I was up over 3,500%. But here is the thing nobody is talking about. Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't the real stories anymore. It's the smaller , lesser known NEW digital currencies that are rewarding investors with the next round of huge wins. For example , I recently obtained 27,000 coins in a tiny new digital currency for just 18.5 cents per coin. Those coins now trade for around $4 each- 1,981% higher. And I invested in another one that's jumped from $1.50 to $10.71. Yet this opportunity is just getting started . Today I'll show you the new digital currencies that can turn as little as $10 into over $1million... in the blink of an eye. Yes, that's right... a single crisp of $10 bill could make you a millionaire. It's not only possible... it's actually happening right now . Consider , investors have seen gains of... 75,063% in Cryptonite, 59,577% in InfluxCoin, 60,450% in MaxCoin, and even 823,750% in DubaiCoin! Tiny new digital currencies are offering profits far bigger than bitcoin and much more quickly. I've personally made over 600% in one digital currency more than 1,981 in a second and over 3,500% in another, and I expect to make a whole lot more. Digital currencies are the one place in the markets where you can start with $10 and turn that into real money fast. CNBC did a story on a high school dropout who bought Bitcoin at $12 and is now a millionaire. And the top investors in the world are going all in on the new digital currencies. Now this is what you guys out there should know . A new set of coins are being launched now that could help you turn as little as $10 into over $1 million. I've never seen profit opportunities like this before... in any market and at anytime. For example... in one recent week 23 separate digital currencies doubled in value. By comparison, the S&P 500 hasn't seen a single stock double yet this year. But only those who recognize the opportunity right now will see the fast profits. I first got in on Bitcoin at $83.40 and $128... only to watch it soar to over $5,000. But now I've turned my attention to the new digital currencies. For example; I invested in ANTSHARES earlier this year and at the time it was trading for just $1.50 but I watched it climb to $10.71 in less than a month. I invested in tiny new digital currencies of 12 coins and I cashed out 20,000 at $5.50 but still hold the rest... nearly $100,000 in total. There are now dozens of small digital currencies trading for just a few cents that are moving up dramatically over very short periods; like Asch traded for few cents at first but in less than 3 months $100=$,570. NolimitCoin traded for few cents but now $200=5,348 in 6 days. MediterraneanCoin traded for few cents but now $200=8,313 in 3 months.

Until SIA solves the data storage problems they have, SIA has no real world use until the function they are intended for ACTUALY WORKS in a meaningful way, rather than just being a demonstration ALPHA. How siacoins are made is irrelevant in mind as the only value SIA truly has is as a store of DATA, they are still not the viable data storage platform they need to be, they should have invested money in the network operational software rather than wasting time on ASIC development....more and more i feel like SIA is a data storage network that can't store data ... make's me want to sell sell sell sell", "Keep doing great things Vosk!

Sound reasonable to you?  It does to me because this is exactly what lightning network does for bitcoin... it's a layer-two solution which speeds up transactions by bundling them off-chain into one net result and then submitting that result on-chain...and so by default, individual transactional data will be obfuscated on the on-chain ledger. \nAnd if it's through Hyperledger, hyperledger deals with private networks and so transactions are obfuscated to outside observers by default. I  believe Hyperledger can act as a layer-two solution for Stellar because it is IBM's enterprise solution that deals with private networks only and as such IBM wanted to use the Stellar network as a public payments conduit for it's Hyperledger customers who need access to public payment networks like Stellar.\nBecause lightning network is for high volume stellar micropayments to be processed off-chain and IBM is in charge of Hyperledger, I believe IBM will use Hyperledger (if it can interface with the Stellar network) or build a layer-two solution to integrate private Hyperledger payments onto the Stellar ledger as a layer-two solution.", "Mastercard and visa are the next fax machine.....", "Guys you are missing the point.... we don\u2019t need visa or MasterCard because we have wallets on our phones.... i send my mom money each month that way and she then goes to a BTC ATM and withdraws", "Isn\u2019t xrp with master card", "Thanks for the awesome update, Dave!", "You already can buy lambo, i believe that you dont worry about that :D", "Hi Dave, using your channel and location to access real players in crypto is of value to us.

The condition of a prefix of a certain amount of 0 in the hash of a block chaining it to the previous one is a condition you need both to make it hard to get a new block but then not too hard so transactions need too long. It's the part of the algorithm, which is no real optimum, only a compromise between these two needs. It's the weak point, not security wise but performance wise. I understand why you'd praise it as a nice idea, but in a classic centralized and trusted scenario that wouldn't need that stunt, you could chain the data with the normal hash with no added constraints, and that is in fact used to have a cryptographic chain of transactions in point of sale systems as a data collection protocol or ledger of all payments.I did implement such a system 2016/2017.\n\nThere are more important weak points from the economics  point of view, though: A currency that measures its success by looking at the exchange rate for the dollar or any other traditional currency is still stating this currency still has the lead. Also a currency finally - when mining ends settling on a fixed amount of money would mean deflation. That is something high inflation countries (http://nomadcapitalist.com/2017/08/04/countries-highest-inflation-in-the-world/) would dream about, but a healthy currency is having a mild inflation as incentive to make use of it. Deflation only looks good at first glance. A deflationary currency is a currency, that'll only be used as an investment, that'll kill it, too, it rather propels the other currencies you compare it with and measure the rising value with. Which leads back to point one, the real currency people trust still is the USD or a mix of YEN, EUR and USD, the \u00a5\u20ac$ axis.

What's the name of the artist/song that starts at 14:17? It's groovy for sure :-)", "Cool video. Some points: On bitcoin, you can send money to addresses that don't stem from a viable public key (albeit why would you) and also if you create an address from a public key (via a hash), you can already send money to that address before ever disclosing the public key. The public key first appears on the ledger with the first signature (which on bitcoin you'd most likely use to send money away from an address). Also, it's not the case that every crypto currency has a blockchain as underlying ledger. I have a few videos on computing hashes and general directed acyclic graphs on my channel.", "What is bitcoin?\n\nIts the agreement that we can use text files instead of money.\nEveryone can write whatever he wants in this text file but only if you write how much money you have it will be valid.\n\nSince everyone can write any amount - these txt files are public so everyone can see everyone's money so if you wanted to cheat or steal, that would be impossible.\n\nPeople up to this point have no problem understanding what bitcoin is. Where people get confused is on bitcoin mining!\n\nWhat is mining?\n\nOk, since these are money and you use them for transactions, we need to make these transactions secure. A major flaw in securing anything around the globe is ... well the \"round\" part!\n\nSince the Earth is round, time in each country varies... Some countries are 2 hours ahead where others are 2 hours behind - that would be a mess if we tried making the time of each transaction public as we did with the amount of money everybody has...\n\nHackers can easily exploit that situation and mess up the transactions in a way, that we wouldn't be able to tell, which transaction came before or after any other transaction... And If we can't tell that - then our public security system simply loses its purpose and doesn't work.\n\nTherefore we need a way to always know the order in which transactions take place. That's where mining comes into play.\n\nImagine a random math problem. The solution to that problem is a number and that number is the number of an individual person which will be the next guy or girl to make a transaction. Therefore if you want to make a transaction, you need to wait for someone on the entire planet to solve that problem - that you are the solution to - so that you become the next guy in the que for the next legal transaction.\n\n Whoever gets to solve that problem 1st should be rewarded for his efforts and gets some fraction of a bitcoin. *THAT IS MINING*\n\nSo, we can start buying computers, these computers then are filled with all these random math problems, which ultimately get solved and yield a solution which is the number of whoever is to make the next transaction. In that way we don't need to mess up with time. Making bitcoin perfectly secure. The computers can solve thousands of problems per second, so that method works flawlessly - and for the effort of whoever is running these computers, he gets awarded with some bitcoins (fraction of...)\n\nIf you have a entire basement filled with computers that are connected with the databases running these problems - you are considered a professional miner. Your job is to keep those computers running, which basically make bitcoin secure from hackers. And you are getting payed ... in bitcoin!\n\nThat's where bitcoin comes from.

I'm sure I'm older than most who follow Stefan, and I've been a keen student of the market, finance, money, and economics for about 25 years. I read \"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and The Madness of Crowds\" in the mid-1990s, highly recommended. I got a bit suckered in myself during the dot-com bubble (kids, investing in 7 different telecom stocks turns out NOT to be proper diversification, who knew? Neither is investing in 7 different cryptos). One thing clear to me when I bothered finally to pay some attention to crypto last year is that there was simply no good argument in support of it. \n\nPeople who thought they were smart were saying things they thought were smart -- but obvious to me, they had no idea what they were talking about and they were not  thinking intelligently about market dynamics or the prospects of crypto as viable money. And that continues. Equally obvious was that the huge mass of people drawn in, in 2017, were unsophisticated rubes who had no idea what they were doing. Easy to see from their nonsense defensive statements and cheering. Also obvious is that every inch of the cyrpto market is soaked in fraud and manipulation.  There was a time people thought Bitcoin would be a viable currency. But it's failure has already occurred, past tense. Value exists in the interaction of supply and human demand. So at the moment, yeah there is enough manipulation-influenced demand that people are paying $6500 for bitcoin. But you got to think deeply about the persistence of that demand.  Bitcoin has already failed as a future-currency (not to mention the potentially infinite supply of other crap-coins), and there is no good reason for it to exist. Nice try, didn't work out. When that demands fades away as true-believers fall away, the price will go where it belongs long-term.", "Bitcoin's 20k all time high was manipulation and then more manipulation to bring it back down. nonetheless the long term prospects are lucrative. Blockchain is like the internet back in 95'", "I don't think crypto will have much traction long term. Much of the benefits crypto has can be mirrored with government backed currency. Things like Paypal, apple pay, google pay will have all the same quick transaction speeds without the huge risk crypto has, ultimately crypto will just offer anonymity and most people don't value that over stability.", "Considering monero since it has a better usecase.

No one can know whether they're emotional about something.\n2. The reasoning that cryptocurrencies will go up is simply because they solve A REAL PROBLEM of boom and bust cycles. I explained this to you in your last video. Feel free to continue to ignore this. \n3. Gold and silver are not volatile. This is the deception you receive because we deal in fiat all the freaking time. Approximately the same amount of gold would get you a good dinner over the last 100 years. The only reason fiat \"seems\" stable is because it's acceptable as stable over a short period of time, while in reality there's constant inflation in everything of AT LEAST 3%/year. The problem with your logic is that you're speaking very short term. Compare the stability of gold/silver to fiat over 20 years and you'll see the difference. Again, don't compare them to fiat directly, but something else like a basket of goods or other services whose scarcity has not changed, and you'll see that gold and silver are WAY more stable, ignoring bubbles that are short termed anyway. Buying gold and silver is not a short term act. That's stupid to even think of. It's the long term hedge is why people buy them, again, ignoring speculations and bubbles.\n4. Cryptocurrencies have a low market cap, that's why they're volatile. When they rise (which is inevitable upon the next economic crisis), they'll become more stable. Think of it as if a business has the capacity to manipulate 1 billion dollars. By today's numbers that's 0.5% of crypto markets, which is relatively high. If crypto is to reach 5 trillion one day, that billion would be 0.002%, which is nothing and manipulation would not be as successful, and hence the prices would stabilize. Also don't forget that this is new tech, so it still is undetermined how valuable it's intrinsically based on the amount of problems it solves.\n5. Gold and silver and cryptos have one thing in common that gives them value: Scarcity. Cryptos don't have intrinsic values and no one claimed that; and is not backed by anything. Show me who said that! That's nonsensical!\n6. For the millionth time: The only difference between crypto and fiat is that crypto is not corruptible because it's based on consensus, while fiat is corruptible and no one knows how much a central bank decides to print the next day and change interest rates to cause another economic bust like 2008, which is coming soon. With crypto, that WON'T HAPPEN. If you look at the numbers, you'll see that central banks are printing money to buy commodities and stocks... how disgusting is that? That's exactly what happened during the big depression! Can that ever happen with crypto? NO! Because no one can PRINT MONEY.\n7. It's not silly to say that fiat is not backed by anything, because the term \"not back by anything\" means that it can be PRINTED WITH NO LIMITS, which is HAPPENING! Not only that, but setting the country to infinite debt... all that is because the government is in charge of economics! Cryptocurrencies separate states and economics, which solves the boom/bust cycles problems.\n8. Cryptos may not go back up. That's possible. But mark your words and learn from your mistakes if you're wrong. The problem with people like you, Stefan, with all due respect, is that you don't learn from your wrong speculations.\n9. The founder of Litecoin, Lee, TOLD PEOPLE that this was mania/bubble. He didn't lie. Where the hell do you get your info from?\n10.

If so, you're a time traveler!", "The world is fucked", "This is a very rosy rendition of bitcoin.  There are still some substantial problems with it:\n-  There are no banks involved, but since most of us don\u2019t mine for bitcoin, you will be forced to use an \u201cexchange\u201d which really resembles a bank in terms of the fees they charge.\n- At least bank transactions have a little bit of anonymity, but bitcoin is a completely public ledger.  The government has also proven that it can regulate, tax and seize it very efficiently.  You are visible to the government by your activities within exchanged.\n- It has no intrinsic value.  Some people claim that the electricity used to make a bitcoin was the tangible value.  However, the electricity has been lost.  Losing electricity is not valuable.  If the same electricity were used to make gold, a tangible usable product is created.  A cryptographic number is not inherently valuable.\n- Markets inherently \u201cknow\u201d that currencies like bitcoin are not valuable.  This can be proven by increasing the money supply.  If we double the money supply, inflation results and the wealth is effectively diluted.  However, if we minted the same quantity of gold coins and doubled the money supply with gold, no such inflation would occur.\n- Therefore, bitcoin\u2019s value is derived solely from public opinion.  Folks who hold large amounts of bitcoin know this and will often be seen online touting how wonderful bitcoin is.  Better opinion = higher price.\n- Volatility makes for a poor store of wealth and a poor transaction medium.  Some shops charge a premium for a transaction just to cover the possibility of losing money because the price of bitcoin may fluctuate.\n- Bitcoin is not an investment.  Investing in bitcoin is a misnomer.  That\u2019s like investing in casino chips or investing in a bank account.  By investing in an asset like a widget maker, one can produce widgets, thereby increasing the value of the investment.  Bitcoin does not create value, and is therefore not an investment. \n- The IRS treats each transaction as a \u201ctaxable event\u201d.  Therefore, if you get out of bitcoin with a profit and into another cryptocurrency at a substantial loss, you may owe more taxes than you have.  This rule can completely bankrupt you.\n- The NSA released a paper on the mathematics of cryptocurrencies in the distant past.  This is very likely a government test project to judge the fitness of the cryptocurrency concept.  Cryptocurrencies make tracking transactions much easier for the government.  Especially If \u201cfedcoin\u201d is ever released.  This can only diminish freedom.", "Awesome video.

This is game changing because it removes the middle man. This puts the power to exchange wealth back in our own hands. And it keeps our hard earned wealth from being eroded by inflation. Inflation is theft. If I exchange a days labor for $100 but then the central bank prints more money and waters down my \"money\" into less buying power, that bank has stolen some of my value.

But if banks can just buy up Bitcoin and lend it, I don't see how anything is going to really change.  And if there are other Cryptocurrencies that have no limit, what's to stop the banks from favoring those over Bitcoin, so that they can just continue creating more and more of it as they do now?  Moreover, anybody with the technical knowledge could create a new cryptocurrency and try to build a market for it.  So, how many cryptocurrencies are we going to see created, then?
